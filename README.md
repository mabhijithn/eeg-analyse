# EEG analysis using python

_There are many toolboxes available for EEG analysis in python. However, I have found that most of these toolboxes involve a steep learning curve. Moreover, visualization is a tough sell for many such toolboxes. This toolbox is start of a journey towards a simple, easily re-useable toolbox in python which will help researchers read, analyse and visualize EEG recorded and distributed in various formats._


## v0.1:
Functions in python to read and re-reference:
1. EDF files (Temple University Seizure Corpus format)
2. MAT file (exported from `matlab` using format specified)
3. DAT file recorded using [CURRY 8 X – Data Acquisition and Online Processing](https://compumedicsneuroscan.com/product/curry-data-acquisition-online-processing-x/)



### Sample Data:

1. EDF files can be found in this [link](https://www.isip.piconepress.com/projects/tuh_eeg/html/downloads.shtml).
2. A sample MAT file is provided in sample-data folder
3. [Ultra high-density 255-channel EEG-AAD dataset](https://zenodo.org/record/4518754): This toolbox is the official python support for the dataset.
